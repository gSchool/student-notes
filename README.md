# Planning for advisory communication increase project

Please help me come up with a name, this one sucks beyond normality

## Problem:

I'm (Brooks) having trouble knowing who to reach out to, or even being able to reach out to instructors regarding advisory group members. On top of it all I'm not necessarily sure who I want to have a one on one with and in what order. When I do have a one on one I don't know what that student has been told by other instructors, or what other instructors think is necessary for them. This causes me to miss important things during the conversation and allows students to fall through the cracks even faster than through the previous lead instructor times.

There are many students who are extremely behind in g75, and with instructors leaving who were the primary contact of these and other students when I take them on I have no idea what they have been told. I am essentially starting over with them even though they expect me to know exactly where they are, and what they have been told.

There is another insidious potential here. Students can be told by one instructor privately to do something. Other instructors don't know that so this student can just avoid contact with their 'lead' and then get away with hiding for a long time.

## Solution:

I want to have an easy place to log in and see all students, and be able to see just my advisory group under normal situations. Here I can easily tell if the students have been having ongoing contact with their instructors or if they haven't had a 1 on 1 in a long time.

I want to be able to peruse through all notes that every instructor has left about a student. Along with links to the PLP's and PIPs if the student is on them. Of course I would also like to know if they are finished with them as well or if they are currently active.

For the future it would be great to see if they have been recently using the help queue and a link to their pace.

### Potential workflow

I've got this as a possible workflow as an instructor

#### Log in

#### View all students

* I can see a list of all students registered.
* From here I can tell if a student hasn't had a one on one in a long time (time frame TBD)
* What cohort the student is in
* What advisor the student belongs to
* The students name
* If the student has red flags

I can filter the students by

* advisory group
* name
* cohort
* pip status
* plp status
* red flags

#### Clicking on a student

This takes us to the student dashboard. Here we can see

* History of all notes left by instructors about the student
* Form to add a note
* Any red flags
* Form to add a red flag
* Links to any PLPs
* Links to PIPs
* Links to create PLP or PIP forms
* Status of PIPS and PLPs
* We can see who left each note
